Let's walk through both a high-level design (HLD) and a low-level design (LLD) for a Splitwise-like application. I'll provide an overview of the architecture, key components, and interactions to help visualize how the system works from both perspectives.

High-Level Design (HLD)
1. System Architecture:

The system follows a distributed microservices-based architecture, utilizing RESTful APIs to manage different functionalities, such as User Management, Expense Management, and Notifications.
Cloud Deployment: Deploy services on a cloud platform like AWS or Azure for scalability, with load balancers to handle user requests.
Client-Server Model: Mobile and web clients communicate with backend servers through APIs.
2. Core Components:

Client-Side Applications:
Web Application: Responsive web app developed using modern front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
Mobile Application: Native apps for iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin) or cross-platform using frameworks like Flutter or React Native.
API Gateway:
Acts as a single entry point for all client requests.
Handles authentication, routing, and rate limiting.
Microservices:
User Management Service: Handles user registration, authentication (e.g., OAuth2), and profile management.
Expense Management Service: Handles expense creation, modification, deletion, and split calculations.
Group Management Service: Manages the creation and management of groups.
Settlement Service: Tracks and manages settlements between users.
Notification Service: Manages sending email/push notifications.
Report Generation Service: Generates downloadable reports in different formats.
Currency Conversion Service: Provides currency conversion for different expenses using third-party APIs.
Database:

SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL):
Stores structured data like user information, groups, and expenses.
NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB):
Stores unstructured data, such as logs and notifications.
Caching Layer:
Redis: Caches frequently accessed data (e.g., user balances) to reduce database load and improve response time.
Message Broker:
RabbitMQ/Kafka: Facilitates communication between microservices for asynchronous operations like notifications and settlement processing.
Authentication Service:
Implements OAuth2 and JWT-based authentication for securing user data.
External Integrations:
Third-Party APIs: Integrate with email services (e.g., SendGrid) for email notifications and payment gateways for settlements.
3. Key Interactions:

Users log in via the Authentication Service.
Clients interact with the API Gateway to make requests (e.g., add expense).
The Expense Management Service validates and stores expense details, calculates splits, and communicates with other services.
Notification Service sends reminders and notifications to users asynchronously.
4. High-Level Data Flow:

Expense Creation:
User creates an expense → API Gateway → Expense Management Service → Database.
Updates balances between users and generates notifications.
Debt Settlement:
User initiates settlement → Settlement Service processes and updates balances → Notification Service sends confirmation.
5. Technology Stack:

Frontend: React/Vue.js (Web), Flutter/React Native (Mobile)
Backend: Golang or Node.js for microservices.
Database: PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for unstructured data.
Cache: Redis
Message Broker: RabbitMQ/Kafka
Cloud Provider: AWS/Azure for deployment.
